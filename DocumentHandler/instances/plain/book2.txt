PREFACE


This catalogue describes the paintings in the Gallery of Art of The New
York Historical Society, with two hundred and eighty-six miniatures,
comprising the Marié Collection and seventy-six objects of Sculpture.

The New York Gallery of Fine Arts, presented to the Society in 1858,
with paintings donated to the Society at various times, are numbered
1 to 488 inclusive. Any notice of this collection would be deficient
which should fail to commemorate the name of Luman Reed, Patron of
American Art. In this connection the Society was chiefly indebted to the
liberality and cordial coöperation of one of their most valued members,
who was himself the chief promoter of the original design of the New
York Gallery of Fine Arts, Mr. Jonathan Sturges.

The Bryan Collection, presented to the Society in 1867 by the late
Thomas J. Bryan, numbers three hundred and eighty-one paintings and are
designated by the letter B. before each number.

The Durr Collection, presented to the Society in 1882 by the executors
of the late Louis Durr, numbers, with subsequent additions, one hundred
and eighty-one paintings, which are designated by the letter D. before
each number.

Short biographical sketches of deceased artists represented in the above
collections have been added, together with indexes to Artists, portraits
and donors.

The Marié Collection of miniatures is arranged alphabetically by
subjects and is not included in the index of portraits.

LUMAN REED


Luman Reed was born in Green River, Columbia County, N. Y., in 1785,
and died in 1836. He removed when a boy to Coxsackie, N. Y., where he
was educated in an ordinary school at the expense of an uncle. Later he
was employed in a country store and subsequently became the partner and
brother-in-law of his employer.

He made frequent trips to New York City on a sloop called the
"Shakespeare," belonging to the firm, selling produce of the farms
around Coxsackie and purchasing goods in New York for his country store.
Later he became a merchant in New York and between the years 1815 and
1832 he gained a fortune. It was then that he began to gratify other
instincts and art attracted his attention. He became the patron of
American Art and sought the acquaintance of artists, interesting himself
in their labors, giving them many commissions for work.

Mr. Reed lived at 13 Greenwich Street, this city, the third story of
which building he used as a picture gallery, to which visitors were
admitted one day each week. This room was also a meeting place for the
artists and literary men of the time. The paintings after Mr. Reed's
death were purchased by his friends and subsequently constituted the
New York Gallery of Fine Arts which, after an uncertain existence of
about twelve years, was forced to close its affairs. Eighty of these
paintings, presented in 1858, are now in the possession of this Society
and known as the New York Gallery of Fine Arts.

The death of Mr. Reed was greatly lamented by the artists of his time
and his name has come down to this generation as the Patron of American
Art.

1-5. The Course of Empire. _Thomas Cole._

     A series of five pictures, illustrating a nation's rise,
     progress, greatness, decline, and fall, and the consequent changes
     in the same landscape.

     NOTE.--The isolated rock, crowning a precipitous hill, in the
     distance, identifies the scenes in each of the series; but the
     observer's position varies in the several pictures.

    "First freedom, and then glory, when that fails,
    Wealth, vice, corruption."

     (_Reed Collection._)

     (_New York Gallery of Fine Arts._)

[FIRST OF THE SERIES.]

1. The "Savage State," or "Commencement of Empire." (61½X39.)

     The sun is rising from the sea, over a wild scene of rocks,
     forests, and mountains, dissipating the clouds and darkness of
     night. Man, attired in skins, is seen engaged in the wild dance
     and the chase--the characteristic occupations of the savage life.
     In the picture, we have the first rudiments of society. Men have
     banded together for mutual aid. The useful arts have commenced in
     the construction of the canoe, the weapon, and the hut; and we may
     imagine the germs of two of the fine arts, music and poetry, in the
     singing usually accompanying the dance of the savage. The empire
     is asserted, to a limited extent, over sea, land, and the animal
     kingdom. It is the season of Spring--the morning of the nation's
     existence.

[SECOND OF THE SERIES.]

2. "The Arcadian," or "Pastoral State." (62½X39.)

     Ages have passed; a change has been wrought in the scene--man
     has subjugated "the untracked and rude." We now see the shepherd
     and his flocks; the ploughman upturning the soil, and the wafting
     sail; by the shore a village, and on the hill the ascending smoke
     of sacrifice. In this picture we have agriculture, commerce, and
     religion. In the aged man describing the mathematical figure, the
     rude attempt of the boy in drawing; in the female figure with the
     distaff, the vessel on the stocks; in the primitive temple, and the
     dance of the peasants to the music of the pipe, we have evidence of
     the advance made in science, in the useful and the fine arts.

     It is early Summer, and the sun has ascended midway to the
     meridian.

[THIRD OF THE SERIES.]

3. "The Consummation of Empire." (75X50½.)

     The rude village has become a magnificent city. From the
     bay--now a capacious harbor, with _phari_ at the entrance, and
     thronged with war-galleys, and barks with silken sails--ascend
     piles of architecture, temples, domes, and colonnades. The massive
     bridge, the streets and squares, lined with palaces and adorned
     with statuary, clustered columns, and sparkling fountains, are
     crowded with gorgeous pageants and triumphal processions. It
     is a day of triumph--man has conquered man--nations have been
     subjugated. By wealth and power, knowledge, art, and taste, man has
     achieved the summit of human grandeur.

     The sun is near the meridian.

[FOURTH OF THE SERIES.]

4. "Destruction." (62½X38½.)

     Ages have passed away since the scene of glory. Luxury has
     enervated, vice has debased, and the strength of the mighty nation
     has consumed away. A barbarous enemy sacks the city. The heavens
     are darkened by a tempest, and the storm of war rages beneath, amid
     falling walls and colonnades, and the flames of temples and palaces.

[FIFTH OF THE SERIES.]

5. "Desolation." (61X39½.)

     The moon ascends the twilight sky, near where the sun rose in
     the first picture. The last rays of the departed sun illumine a
     lonely column of the once proud city, on whose capital the heron
     has built her nest. The shades of evening steal over shattered and
     ivy-grown ruins. The steep promontory, with its insulated rock,
     still rears against the sky, unmoved, unchanged; but violence and
     time have crumbled the works of man, and art is again resolving
     into elemental nature. The gorgeous pageant has passed; the roar of
     battle has ceased; the multitude has sunk in the dust; the empire
     is extinct.

    _Within their alabaster innocent arms;_
    _Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,_
    _Which in their summer beauty, kiss'd each other._

THE BRYAN COLLECTION




THOMAS J. BRYAN


Thomas Jefferson Bryan was the son of Guy Bryan and Martha Matlock, his
wife. He was born at "Spring Hill," Philadelphia, Pa., about 1800, and
died at sea, May 14, 1870, on board the French steamship "Lafayette,"
while on his way to New York, four days out from Havre, France.

Mr. Bryan graduated at Harvard University in 1823 and studied law, but
he never practiced his profession, as he had an adequate inheritance.

Much of his time was given to foreign travels in forming a valuable
collection of paintings. For a time this collection, known as the Bryan
Gallery of Christian Art, was displayed on the walls of a spacious room
in a house on the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth Street, where an
admission fee of twenty-five cents was charged to view the paintings,
Mr. Bryan himself being the custodian in charge. He next deposited them
in the Cooper Union, and in 1867 he deeded the entire collection to the
New York Historical Society, which he catalogued, arranged and added to
from time to time until his death in 1870.

THE BRYAN COLLECTION

BYZANTINE SCHOOL


NO. SUBJECTS OF PAINTINGS. ARTISTS.

B-1. Virgin and Child. (15X13.)

     The Virgin, clothed in a rich crimson drapery which covers
     the head, holds the infant CHRIST on her right arm. The child
     has a gilt globe in his hand. Over his head is seen the date of
     the picture, MXC. It was brought from the East by the celebrated
     artist, PAPETI, who was sent to Greece by the French Government.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-2. Triptique. (8X20½.)

     A very remarkable and elaborate work; and of the highest
     interest in the history of art.

     (_Bryan Collection._)


ITALIAN SCHOOL

B-3. A Virgin and Child, with four Saints. (77½X39½.) _Guido of Siena._

     This picture is in perfect condition, and is from the renowned
     collection of M. Artaud de Montor, in the account of which it was
     engraved. It is described in the work of Gault de St. Germain (p.
     51).

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-4. Virgin and Child, with Saints. (17X9.) Oval Top. _Cimabue._

     From the De Montor collection--engraved.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-5. Knights at a Tournament. (24X24.) Round. _Giotto di Bondone._

     The frame is as ancient as the picture itself, of which it
     forms a part. It bears the arms of the Medici family. From the De
     Montor collection--engraved.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-6. Virgin and Child. (12½X8½.) _Simone Memmi._

     The head of the Virgin presents the same type as that
     exhibited in the portrait of PETRARCH'S LAURA, painted by MEMMI,
     which is in the Library of the Vatican. From the De Montor
     collection--engraved.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-7. The Last Judgment. (12½X8½.) _Simone Memmi._

     "CHRIST, with the cruciform halo, and the elliptical aureola,
     bordered with cherubim, appears in the heavens. Above, two angels,
     strangely enough colored entirely blue, sound the trumpet; below,
     the Virgin and ST. JOHN kneel upon the ground, from which rises the
     cross, on which two angels are looking. On the left, the elect,
     wearing crowns of gold, mount towards the sky, under the protection
     of a pitying spirit; on the right, the damned, covered with blood,
     are delivered to the demons by a minister of divine vengeance.
     JESUS himself wears a terrible expression. MICHAEL ANGELO is,
     therefore, not the first to have given him this menacing aspect.
     The general color of the picture pleases the eye by its extreme
     fineness: the Virgin and ST. JOHN by the beauty of their types."
     To this just and graphic description from the pen of M. Michiels,
     which appeared in the _Gazette de France_, it is needless to add
     anything more. From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-8. The Crucifixion. (8X21.) _Taddeo Gaddi._

     From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-9. St. Jerome, St. Dominic, and St. Francis of Assisi. (15X10.) Oval
Top. _Taddeo Gaddi._

     The three Saints stand side by side. There is dignity in the
     attitudes and the draperies, and harmony in the color of this
     picture. From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-10. Two Wings of a Tabernacle. (19X8½.) _Lorenzo il Monaco._

     From the De Montor collection.

SCHOOL OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY

B-16. A Tabernacle. (20½X18.)

     The carved arabesque work indicates the period of this
     picture, which has been much injured by the hand of time.

     From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)


ANCIENT VENETIAN SCHOOL

B-17. Virgin adoring the Infant Jesus. (18½X11.)

     The Virgin kneels before her Divine Son. Around are angels,
     and behind her is JOSEPH. Above is a company of angels; and, in the
     distant sky, one is seen appearing to the shepherds. The infant
     has a crimson, cruciform aureola. In this rudely-drawn picture the
     future glory of the Venetian School, its gorgeous color, is plainly
     indicated.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-18. The Birth of John the Baptist. (24X24.) _Uccello._

     From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-19. Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. (3½X3½.) _Castagno._

     From the De Montor collection.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-22. Adoration of the Infant Christ. (79½X5½.) _Perugino._ [_Macrino
d'Alba._]

     The Virgin MARY, ST. JOHN the Baptist, ST. JEROME, ST. JOSEPH,
     ST. MICHAEL, and the Pope JULIUS II., are kneeling before the
     divine infant. Three small Angels, also kneeling, carry the nails
     and the Cross, emblems of the torture which the new-born should
     suffer. The CHRIST bears a striking resemblance to that of the
     little JESUS, so much admired, in a painting of the same artist,
     now placed in the Louvre, after having decorated the gallery of the
     King of Holland. ST. MICHAEL strikes the beholder by his noble air
     and his martial type. The head is evidently the portrait of GASTON
     DE FOIX, the model of the chivalry of the day. ST. JOHN is the
     lean prophet of the desert, the ascetic, and the eater of locusts
     and wild honey. At the top of the picture, three Angels play upon
     different instruments. In the background are seen the Capitol, the
     image of Roman power, and the vast ruins of the Coliseum. The head
     of JOSEPH, who stands behind ST. JOHN, must strike the considerate
     observer by its close resemblance to the type of JOSEPH which we
     find in the Holy Families of RAPHAEL. In the Cherub who holds
     the Cross, we also find great similarity to the little Angel who
     occupies so prominent a position in the famous Madonna of Foglino,
     from the same divine pencil. From the collection ERRARD. Signed and
     dated 1509.

B-25. The Birth and Resurrection of Christ. (11X19½.) _Raphael._

     In the centre of the upper compartment, CHRIST, draped in
     red, and bearing the emblematic banner of the Cross, rises from
     an open tomb. His hand is raised with an expression of command.
     On each side are two soldiers sleeping, and two starting away in
     fright. A slender tree also is seen upon each side of the tomb; in
     the distance is a large hill. In the lower compartment are eight
     figures, besides the infant CHRIST. Six kneel in a semicircle about
     the new-born Saviour, who lies in the middle of the foreground.
     Three of these, on the left, are shepherds. On the right are the
     Virgin mother and two Angels. Next to MARY sits JOSEPH; and on the
     extreme left, a fourth shepherd approaches. Two slender trees here
     also appear on each side of the composition. In the distance are
     heavily undulating hills.

     Very few Raphaels of this period exist. Those which are in
     the Vatican and the Louvre, show, in style and handling, an exact
     similarity to these pictures, which is absolutely conclusive. The
     donor wishes it to be understood, that, in his opinion, and in that
     of some of the accomplished and practised experts in Europe, there
     is not the slightest doubt of the authenticity of these pictures.
     Only the inexperienced and the uncultivated fail to trace in them
     the pencil of the divine RAPHAEL.

     Nine Cupids dance in a ring. On the left, one plays upon

     Two men and a naked female sit in the open air, diverting

     from the shrubbery, which is not in the original, but found only in
     Watteau's Pastiche, No. B-247.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-33. The Repose in Egypt. (32½X41½.) _Titian._

     This composition was repeated many times by TITIAN, and
     without great variation. This repetition is distinguished by the
     absence of some figures in the background, and the introduction
     of a rivulet in the foreground, and a butterfly upon a flower in
     the right corner. It has twice been found necessary to remove the
     picture from its canvas: the drapery of the Virgin has suffered
     somewhat from this and other causes; the other parts of the picture
     are somewhat injured.

EARLY FLORENTINE SCHOOL

B-43. Virgin and Child, with St. John. (10X81.)

     It will be noticed that gold is used freely in the halos, and
     upon the draperies, which fall in somewhat stiff but ample and
     not unpleasing folds. This picture is from the collection of the
     Abbé GENOUDE, known as the translator of the Bible, by which he
     accumulated a fortune.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-44. Adoration of the Shepherds. (35½X34.)

     This picture is from the collection of the Sylvestre family,
     and was once improperly attributed to RAPHAEL. It bears many of the
     marks of GAROFALO'S pencil.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-45. The Crucifixion. (33X23.) _Andrea Mantegna._

     Mr. Michiels, the distinguished critic employed by the Belgian
     Government to prepare a history of Flemish Art, says of this work:
     "The CHRIST has a nobility in his attitude which few painters
     have been able to give him; the expression of the good robber is
     also grave and dignified. The whole picture bears the impress of
     a serene imagination; the coloring is sombre; the attitudes are
     distinguished by an air of majesty. We feel that the artist had, at
     the commencement of his career, severely studied the ancients. Two
     cuirasses, and some of the draperies, are gilded; gold is mingled
     with the other costumes, in the form of _traits,_ designating the
     folds. We are particular about these details, because they indicate
     the primitive epoch in which the picture was painted, and the
     manner in which they passed from the use of gold grounds to the
     entire abandonment of that metal."

     It should be observed that the Jewish type is preserved in the
     heads of many of the figures, which is the case of the works of
     very few other masters. It will be observed that there are in this
     crowded canvas no two pieces of offensive or defensive armor alike.
     This is worthy of particular remark, as SQUARCIONI, the master of
     MAN TEGNA, had the largest and most varied collection of ancient
     arms which existed in his day.

     Aside from its intrinsic merit, this picture is of the
     greatest interest when considered in connection with the _St.
     Jerome_ (B-47) by CORREGGIO, the disciple of MANTEGNA. In the
     peculiar mode of introducing gold in the lights of that noble
     painting, we notice an unmistakable similarity to MANTEGNA'S use of
     the same material in the work before us; thus showing the direct
     connection between the manner of the two painters.

     It is impossible to overrate the historical importance of the
     juxtaposition of this work of MANTEGNA with that of CORREGGIO.
     There is afforded in no other gallery, public or private, in the
     world, a similar opportunity to study the master and scholar side
     by side in works of unquestionable authenticity and the highest
     intrinsic merit.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-46. Adoration of the Kings. (19X14.) _Andrea Mantegna._

     Found in Venice, 1859.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-47. The Virgin and Child, Mary Magdalen, and St. Jerome (known as the
St. Jerome). (19X14.) _Correggio._

     Of this sketch M. Michiels remarks, that in it "burns in all
     its grace the talent of _Correggio_. Never has the Ecstasy of
     piety, or the fervor of religious affection, been better expressed."

     This picture differs from the large one at Parma, in the
     absence of the emblematic lion which stands in that by the side
     of ST. JEROME; and also in the color of some of the draperies,
     particularly in that of the canopy, which in this is striped,
     while in that it is of one color. In this, too, we find gold
     used in the halos and in the draperies, which is not the case in
     the other; a fact which points to the earlier production of this
     picture, and which also connects it in a remarkable manner with the
     _Crucifixion_ by _Mantegna_ (No. B-45).

     There can be no doubt that this picture is the finished sketch
     for the well-known _St. Jerome_, at Parma. The marked differences
     already alluded to in minor points, prove incontestably that it
     could not be the work of a copyist, who would, of course, reproduce
     his original with all possible fidelity. It is from the collection
     of Marshal Sebastiani, it having been nailed firmly to the wall in
     his bed-chamber.

B-48. Virgin and Child. (34X27.) _Correggio._

     In support of the authenticity of this picture, we have the

B-57. St. Paul borne to Heaven by Angels. (19½X15.) _Domenichino._

     "Three angels bear aloft the interpreter of the divine will:
     one has the form of infancy, another of youth, the third of
     adolescence. The minister of our Lord raises his hands to heaven,
     on which he gazes with an expression of burning hope. How he seeks
     to discover the first rays of the eternal light! How he longs for
     the moment in which he shall appear before the Almighty! What
     enthusiasm animates his countenance! I doubt if the ardor of faith
     could be better shown. The little angel has those brilliant eyes,
     and that expressive visage, which this master knew so well how to
     paint; it is certainly not inferior to those which we admire in the
     grand salon of the Louvre. The angel of the second age charms the
     eye by a grace and an easiness of attitude extremely remarkable;
     upon his countenance burn the veneration and the love with which
     the Apostle inspires him. The entire group seems actually to mount
     in the air. Mr. Bryan had the good taste to purchase it at the sale
     of M. Forbin-Janson."

     To this just and graphic description, from the pen of M.
     Michiels, which appeared in the _Gazette de France_, it is needless
     to add anything more.

     This picture was formerly in the gallery of the Cardinal
     Lambruschini, and afterwards in the collection of M. Forbin-Janson,
     Director of the Louvre, at whose sale it was purchased by the donor.

     The similarity of many parts of this picture to the works of

     placed his signature over that of the actual painter. Upon cleaning
     the picture, the fictitious signature, of course, disappeared, and
     that of DUBOIS, with the date, 1652, was brought to light; and
     hence results the unmerited obscurity of a landscape painter of no
     mean powers who preceded RUYSDAEL, and whose works are important in
     the history of art, as showing the origin of that Master's style of

B-116. The Crucifixion. (15X14½.) _Jan van Eyck._

     The cross upon which the dead CHRIST is suspended occupies
     the middle of the composition. On the left, ST. JOHN sustains the
     fainting Virgin, behind whom kneels the churchman for whom the
     picture was painted. His name, _Fr(ater) Aurelius de Emael_, is
     written in German-text across his figure. Behind him is a weeping
     female figure; on the left is a group of dignitaries and soldiers.
     A landscape, in which the towers of a distant city appear, closes
     the scene. Underneath the left arm of the cross appears the legend,
     _Vere Filius Dei erat iste_, in Roman characters of the epoch,
     which ceased to be used after the time when the painting in oil
     commenced. The forms in the CHRIST are somewhat meagre, but the
     anatomy is remarkably correct and particular. The expression in the
     faces of the several figures is marked. Modern art rarely shows us
     finer expression. The picture is slightly but admirably restored in
     the left arm of the cross, and a portion of the legend. It is of
     unquestionable authenticity and the extremest rarity.

B-117. Landscape, with Figures. (22X36.) _Jacques Fouquières._

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-118. Landscape. (26X39½.) _Jan Glauber._

     It is unrivalled by any production of the Master known to the
     donor, and is worthy of CLAUDE, to whom it has been attributed by
     some of the most distinguished experts of Europe. The figures are
     by GERARD DE LAIRESSE.

     This little picture is a fair specimen of the Master.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-121. The Marriage of St. Catherine. (36X27½.) Oval Top. _Jan Memling._

     The picture is in remarkably fine condition, and, aside from
     its intrinsic merit, is important in the history of Art. When
     purchased by the donor, its beauties were hidden beneath the
     accumulated blackness of ages; otherwise a private American fortune
     would have failed to obtain it, as the Director of the National
     Academy of Brussels, partly suspecting its value, was a competitor
     for its possession. It was purchased at the sale of the well-known
     _Collection Quedeville_.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-122. The Annunciation. (17X17.) _Copy from Jan Memling._

     This picture, as well as the preceding, is from the
     _Collection Quedeville_, and was supposed, for a long time, by
     some, to be an original; but a comparison of it with the "Marriage
     of St. Catherine," just noticed, will soon convince even the least
     practised eye of the error of this belief.

(BRYAN COLLECTION)]

B-125. Landscape. (25½X30.) _Cornelius Huysmans, of Mechlin._

     This is the finest easel-picture of this Master known to the
     donor. One inferior to it in every respect was placed by the side
     of a HOBBEMA at the exhibition of the British Institution, 1851,
     and sustained itself.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-126. Portrait. (25X20.) _Karl du Jardin._

     Portraits by this Master are very rare.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-127. Landscape, with Figures. (24X21.) _Karl du Jardin._

     The signature is in script, _K. du Jardin_; an unusual one for
     the Master, who almost always signed in Roman letters.

     Purchased in New York city.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-129. Portrait. (48½X39½.) _Sir Peter Lely._

     This is the portrait of a sister to the Duke whose portrait,
     representing him holding an orange, is in the Louvre, and which
     was long attributed to VANDYKE; and the donor, with due deference,
     declares both portraits to be painted by the same artist--Sir PETER
     LELY. It is from the collection of DROLLING, artist.

B-132. Virgin and Child. (27½X22.) _Jan de Mabuse._

     This picture in its composition and expression shows the
     influence of the painter's study in Italy.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-133. A Triptique. (28X39½.) _Quintin Matsys._

     Bodily rather than mental suffering is portrayed in this
     picture by a painter who sought expression alone. His Misers, in
     the English Queen's collection, is the connecting link between the
     early and the more modern Flemish art.

     This picture is from the gallery of Cardinal Fesch, at the
     sale of which it was purchased,--but not by the donor,--as by
     NETSCHER, the true signature being covered by the false one of
     NETSCHER.

B-139. Landscape by Moonlight. (24½X35.) _Arnold van der Neer._

     The figures are by Franck and the picture is signed by both
     masters.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-141. Portrait of Madame de Montespan. (19½X15.) _Caspar Netscher._

     The Duchess sits near a small table, playing upon the harp; at
     her feet sits her son, the Duc de Maine. The artist has intended
     to represent the lady as St. Cecilia. The anvil, hammers, and
     balance, introduced into the painter's design, are allusions to the
     discovery of the musical octave by Pythagoras, and also her sitting
     upon a celestial globe typical of the music of the spheres.

     The group of Hercules and the Lion standing upon a Pedestal
     near the middle of the picture will remind one of RUBENS. (No.
     B-161).

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-152. Portrait. (27X21.) _Paul Rembrandt._

     This portrait is signed with the R., the early signature of
     the Master. It was bought at the sale of the celebrated miniature
     painter SAINT, to whom it belonged, by Mr. Roehn, the celebrated
     connoisseur, and was sold by him as REMBRANDT'S to Mr. Jecker,
     the same who left his important collection of prints to the
     _Bibliothèque National_ at Paris.

B-156. St. John preaching. (29½X42.) _Theodore Rombouts._

     In a former catalogue this picture was classed among unknown
     artists. The donor has since discovered it to be by ROMBOUTS. From
     the collection of General Desport.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-157. View of a Windmill on a Canal. (10½X12½.) _Theodore Rombouts._

     Signed by the artist. Bought in New York city.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-158. St. Catherine. (38½X28½.) _Peter Paul Rubens._

     There are but six pictures of this quality of color by
     RUBENS, known to the donor. Three are in the Louvre, one is
     over the painter's tomb, one is the famous _Chapeau de Paille_,
     and the other is before us. It was brought from a church in the
     neighborhood of Brussels, by NIEUWEN-HUYSEN, the elder, and sold to
     the Count Perregeau.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-159. Christ bearing the Cross. (59X24½.) _Peter Paul Rubens._

     This picture is especially valuable for historical
     considerations, as being the only one which RUBENS is known to have
     painted on cedar panel. It formed one compartment of a triptique in
     the Cathedral of Antwerp. The centre compartment represented the
     Flagellation of Christ.

     The donor has the authority of Mr. HERIS for the authenticity
     of this picture, and the locality from which it was stolen.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-160. Portrait of a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. (44X33.)
_Peter Paul Rubens._

     This picture is from the collection of Louis Philippe, King of
     the French, and was supposed to be by VANDYKE.

_PETER PAUL RUBENS._

(BRYAN COLLECTION)]

B-161. Hercules strangling the Nemean Lion. (80X67.) _Peter Paul Rubens._

     Several persons, whose opinions the donor highly respects,
     have denied the authenticity of this picture; but he thinks that,
     on a careful examination, its wonderful energy and muscular
     movement can be attributed to no other hand, no other head, than
     that of RUBENS. It is the Belvidere Torso--that only acknowledged
     Master of MICHAEL ANGELO--put into action, and was doubtless
     painted in Italy. It is known that _Rubens_ attempted to draw the
     lion from nature, when he was irritated by his keeper. He made but
     a hasty sketch.

     The patient is the painter's own wife; on the right are the
     VAN GOYENS, (her father and mother,) and JAN STEEN himself stands
     on her left, regarding the operation with interest.

     This picture, which is superior to the only specimen of the
     Master in the Louvre, was purchased from the Gallery of the Count
     De Turenne, the last of the family of the celebrated Marshal.

     Signed by the artist, and bought in New York city.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-175. Incantation Scene. (14½X20.) _David Teniers the Younger._

     This picture is unsurpassed by any other of the Master; and
     if ever equalled, it is only by one in the Gallery of Madrid,
     representing TENIERS himself, painting the portrait of the Grand
     Duke Leopold and his family; a picture which makes painters wonder
     and despair. Collection Sylvestre.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

     The Emperor, in full armor, is about to descend the steps of
     a large building. The Archbishop gives him his blessing. Persons
     of dignity, in church and state, are grouped on all sides. In the
     background is the ship in which the Emperor is about to embark.
     This composition is filled with portraits; among which, in the
     figure bearing the standard on the extreme right, we recognize that
     of the Painter himself. Collection D'Espinoy.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-180. Parable of the Laborer who received a Penny. (22X17.) _David
Teniers the Younger._

     In which is introduced the portrait of RUBENS in his medal
     chain, also the portraits of REMBRANDT and other artists and two
     children of TENIERS. From the collection of Louis Philippe.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-181. Landscape and Figures. (9½X13½.) _David Teniers the Younger._

     A wonderful effect, and familiarly styled by painters as the
     "après déjeuner" manner. Bought in New York city.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-182. Portrait of William, Prince of Orange, (William III.) (30½X23.)
_Gerard Terburg._

     This was supposed to be the portrait cited by Descamp as the
     one which William insisted that the artist should paint; he being
     a burgomaster devoted to the Prince's cause. It is signed "G.
     TERBORCH," the only genuine signature of the Master.

B-186. Landscape, with Animals. (9X11½.) _Adrian van de Velde._

     This picture, though small, gives a just idea of the power
     of the Master, from whose pencil the donor has never seen a
     feeble work; though ADRIAN may have adorned with his figures the
     compositions of inferior masters. This picture, together with the
     small landscape by RUBENS (No. B-162), is from an old chateau in
     Normandy.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-187. Landscape, with Figures. (25X33.) _Abraham Verboom._

     So fine a specimen of the Master is rarely to be found. The
     group of figures, by LINGELBACH, is almost worthy of WOUWERMANS.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-188. The Three Graces. (19X15½.) _Chevalier van der Werf._

     From Hunter's collection, New York.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-189. Ruins, with Figures. (22X17½.) _Jan Baptist Weenix._

     In the opinion of the donor, this picture, though striking at
     first, is extremely false in everything, like most others of this
     painter's works. It is from the collection of Cardinal Fesch.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-190. Travellers, by a River-side. (12X16.) _Philip Wouwermans._

     This picture has, unfortunately, been much injured in many
     places; but in the head and shoulders of the white horse may
     be found a specimen of the Master's style of painting; and the
     signature is unquestionably genuine.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-191. Departure of a Hawking Party of Nobles from a Baronial Castle.
(43X51½.) _Philip Wouwermans._

     The largest picture in size and manner which the donor has

     Dec., 1865.

B-192. The Burning and Sacking of a Town. (21X19.) _Philip Wouwermans._

     If not a copy, it is an early picture of the Master, and
     though meritorious, gives no idea of the fullness of his powers.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-193. Landscape. (8X10½.) _Jan Wynants._

     The equestrians and beggar in the foreground are by BARENT

B-194. Still Life. (7¾X10¼.) _Henry Martin Rokes._

     It, as well as the "Sorcery Scene," by TENIERS, ornamented
     the collection of Mons. Sylvestre, whose ancestors have been
     either artists or connected with art since the year 1490. A noble
     pedigree. This artist inherited the name of _Zorg_ (careful) from

     them are from the collection Quedeville.

     It is upon leather, which was stamped and gilded so as to
     form around it a strange quadrangular halo, in which _fleur de
     lis_ is prominent. Upon the edge is an inscription, of which only
     ADORO--REDENTOR, I. H. S., is legible. It is probably not older
     than the latter part of the fourteenth century, and was, doubtless,
     an object of adoration to some devout Catholic.

(39X27.) _Martin Freminet._

     The ornaments in gold, and precious stones, are from the

     copied by modern jewelers.

     (_Bryan Collection._)

B-222. The Repose in Egypt. (36½X30.) _Nicholas Poussin._

     The attitude of the Virgin is remarkable, not only for its
     graceful dignity, but for its perfect expression of the fact that
     she is listening calmly but intently to the narrative which Joseph
     is evidently relating. The landscape, though not highly finished,
     is grandly composed; and upon it the twilight of dawn is made to
     fall with sweet solemnity.

B-223. The Daughter of Pharaoh about to bathe in the Nile. (25½X29.)
_Nicholas Poussin._

     Two attendants are about to disrobe the Princess; a third
     kneels at her feet with a vase of anointing oil. Before her is
     a figure emblematic of the river. The group is finely composed,
     and the forms and attitudes are simple and chaste almost to
     statuesqueness.

     Both these pictures display the knowledge of form, the
     classical taste, and the color which are characteristic of this
     Master, recognized as the _Peintre des Gens d'Esprit_. This
     sketch is in the best manner of POUSSIN, and was formerly in the
     collection of M. de St. Aubin.

B-230. Landscape, with Figures. (39½X50½.) _School of Claude Lorraine._

     The peasants in the foreground are designed after DOMENICHINO;
     but the figure who leans against a tree, in the shadow on the left,
     and plays upon a pipe, is like CLAUDE. CLAUDE was so conscious of
     the want of merit in his pictures, he used to say that he sold his
     landscapes and gave away the people in them. Collection of Marshal
     Sebastiani.

The following described Pictures were STOLEN from the BRYAN COLLECTION
before it was received by the Society.

Cupid discharging an Arrow. _In the style of Correggio._

Cupid after the discharge of the Arrow--with finger raised constraining
silence. _In the style of Correggio._

Adoration of the Magi. _Leonard Bramer._

     The Virgin, with the infant Christ and Joseph, sits in
     front of a ruined building. Around them the Magi are grouped in
     adoration. The distribution of the light in this little picture is
     truly grand, and the color is rich and harmonious. The influence of
     Rembrandt is apparent in every touch.

Vision of St. Louis. _Anthony van Dyck._

     The sainted King starts from a canopied couch to gaze upon
     the apparition of Pope GREGORY IV., who appears before him,
     cloud-borne, and surrounded by angels. In the background is a
     sentinel. This little picture is noble in style and harmonious in
     color. The action of the figures is remarkably free and vigorous.

A Lace-Worker. _Peter De Hooghe._

     A young woman sits by an open window, with her hands
     resting upon the cushion on which is her work. The light falls
     in a broad mass upon one side of her face and figure, while the
     other is in the half-shadow of reflected light. This little
     sketch, so unobtrusive in subject and treatment, will impress
     the close observer with a sense of great power and thorough
     knowledge--knowledge which is content to know without seeming
     learned.

Miniature Portrait. _Balthazar Denner._

     An old man, wearing a cap, and a breastplate over a rich
     doublet. This head is painted with an elaborateness of detail
     worthy of Gerard Douw, while at the same time it is modelled with a
     free and learned hand.

     (_Collection of General Count Turenne._)

WITH ADDITIONS PURCHASED BY THE

DURR GALLERY FUND




LOUIS DURR


Louis Durr was born in Carlsruhe, Germany, in 1821, and died in New
York City, March 31, 1880. His father was the Treasurer of the Duke of
Baden-Baden, and was a watch-maker by trade, as well as a dealer in
works of art.

Mr. Durr graduated from the Lyceum in his native city, and after
visiting Geneva and Paris, came to this country with his brother in
1848 and for a time was connected with Balbach's gold smelting works in
Newark, N. J. In 1853-54 he was established at 111 Nassau Street, this
city, as a refiner of gold and silver. In 1856 he removed to 51 Ann
Street and the following year to 53 Ann Street, where he carried on his
business as an assayer and refiner for many years with his brother.

He accumulated a fortune and spent all his spare time studying and
collecting works of art. He lived at No. 30 East 4th Street, where he
kept his paintings.

He was a member of the Liederkranz Club, then near his home, and became
a member of this Society in 1873.

By will Mr. Durr directed that the most meritorious works of art were to
be selected from his gallery of paintings and placed by his executors in
some public art gallery, to be known as the "Durr Gallery of Paintings,"
the residue of his paintings to be sold and the proceeds invested for
the purchase of suitable additions for the "Durr Gallery of Paintings."

In 1880 the executors of his estate under the terms of his will offered
the collection of paintings to The New York Historical Society, and in
1882 they were transferred to the Society, together with the proceeds of
the above-mentioned sale, which the Society designated the "Durr Gallery
Fund" and from which the Gallery is added to.

     _The Progress of Civilization in America_, a group executed by
     order of the Government for the Capitol extension at Washington.

     "Resting on a low mound is seated the Indian chief, a
     nude figure excellently modeled. His head, crowned with tufted
     feathers, rests sadly upon his hand, the weary chase of life is
     over, he is dying--the Great Spirit waits to conduct him to the
     far off hunting-grounds, that dreamy land where souls repose in
     boundless prairies. His tribe has disappeared, he is left alone,
     the solitary offshoot of a mighty race; already the axe of the
     backwoodsman disturbs his last hours; civilization, and art, and
     agriculture--all mysteries to him incomprehensible--have desecrated
     his home, and the dark shadows of the past gather him into their
     bosom!"--_London Art Journal._

     Purchased from the family of the Artist, and presented by

     Presented by the Artist, February 22, 1911.

74. Ruth. _In marble._ _Henry K. Brown._

     "The artist has chosen the moment in which Ruth is addressed
     by Boaz as she stands among the gleaners. He quoted the lines of
     Keats in the song of the Nightingale--

    'Perchance the self-same song hath found a path
    To the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
    She stood in tears amid the alien corn.'

     She is not in tears; but her aspect is that of one who listens
     in sadness; her eyes are cast down, and her thoughts are of the
     home of her youth in the land of Moab. Over her left arm hangs
     a handful of the ears of wheat which she has gathered from the
     ground, and her right rests on the drapery about her bosom. Nothing
     can be more graceful than her attitude, or more expressive of
     melancholy sweetness and modesty than her physiognomy."--_Extract
     of a letter by Mr. W. C. Bryant, dated Rome, 1845._

     This statue was purchased by Miss Hicks, of New York, and
     presented to the New York Gallery of Fine Arts.

75. Group of a Boy and Dog; or, _Chi Vinci, mangia._ _In marble._ _Henry
K. Brown._

     This playful group was presented to the New York Gallery, by
     C. M. Leupp, Esq. The boy has left his bowl of milk upon the floor,
     and the dog is endeavoring to take advantage of his negligence,
     by appropriating the contents to himself, against which the boy
     stoutly protests. They are so equally matched in strength, that the
     struggle is of doubtful issue, and therefore the artist calls it,
     "_Chi Vinci, mangia_," or, who wins, eats.

     (_New York Gallery of Fine Arts, 1858._)

76. Bacchus. _In marble._

     Presented by Mrs. Howard Townsend Martin, March 13, 1909.

     Transcriber's Notes:

     Obvious typos, spelling and grammar errors were corrected.

     P. 218 changed Rembrandt, Van Ryn to Rembrandt, Paul as the
     forename Paul was used throughout the text. The index should agree
     with the text. However, it is apparent that the artist referred to
     is actually the Rembrandt Van Ryn.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
